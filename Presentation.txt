Hi there! Welcome to my tutorial video!

I'm just going to quickly show you how to run my program. It's
super simple to start and will give you a professional looking 
readme in no time.

 
Hope this helps!
============================================================

Simple open the console on the folder with the generator files in it, then type "node index" in the console to start the program: 

This will present you with a series of prompts. Simply answer the prompts, and these will be presented to you in a readme file!

Observe ===>>

In this option, you are presented with a list of options to choose from. If you did not use and licenses for your program, simply select NO LICENSE USED

As you can see, the file has now been written into the folder with the software.


This file has also been formatted to show links when the file is uploaded to your github.
Hope this helps!
