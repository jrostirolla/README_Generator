# README Generater

## Intro
Hi there, and welcome to my README generater. Using my application, you'll be able to create professional readme files by answering a few quick prompts.

## Installation
* First of all, you will need to direct the console to your cloned git repository
* Next, you will need to initialise the inquirer module. To do this, type "npm install inquirer" to ensure inquirer is installed
* Next, type "node index" in the console to initialise the program
* Next, answer the prompts as guided by the console. Don't worry if you make a mistake, you can easily change it in the generated readme after you are done!

Thank you for using my product!
